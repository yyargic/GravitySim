Newtonian gravity simulation on 2D with PyGame

My friend ekinimo and I (yyargic) wanted to use PyGame for a physics simulation. We hope you enjoy!

test.py is the main file. Choose your gas and run!

In the simulation, you can use the following keyboard commands:
Space: pause/unpause
Q: quit
T: toggle trajectory
P: toggle particle list
